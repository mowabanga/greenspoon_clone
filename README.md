This is a retouched clone version of an ecom site.
The site is responsive and notable improvements form the original site include:
	- Responsive web design
	- A burger menu to reduce clustering
	- Improved design and tiles
	- Image rendering
The front-end bit was done with vanilla HTML, CSS and JS. Did not employ any frameworks.
Working on the back-end right now solely using node.js.
DBMS will be created using mySQL or postgresql.
